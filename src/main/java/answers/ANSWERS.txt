 4. Explain the content of each column (especially the DTYPE column) and how it relates to the object model.

    here we see all attributes in one table, because the default mapping for inheritense is single table,
    the DTYPE is an kind of enumeration of all the classes parent+child classes, the field in the tuple
    will explain which typ of class it comes from.
    -all the other columns pretty much explain themselves. they are from the all the classes, and have to
    be nullable since not all child classes contains the same attributes.

5 Regenerate the tables and explain the purpose/content of each table and each column (especially the DTYPE
column) and how they relate to the object model.

    Now each child class is in a seperate table, this can be useful to optimze normalisation in bigger databases....
